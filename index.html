<p>I used Deepart.io, Prisma, and Snapchat to create the images on this page. Prisma was used for the second
   image and deepart was used for the other two. For the first and second images, the only work required was
   adding filters to the images. For the third picture, I had to distort my face using snapchat, cut out my face,
   insert it onto the Easter Island head and then email myself the photo and apply the filter on Deepart.io. The 
   entire page was created using a single text file combining simple html and css. The web page is hosted on GitHub
   using the GitHub pages feature available in any repository.
